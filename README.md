# crossfit-php
Information to access database:
    $db_user = 'crossfit';
    $db_pass = 'password';
    $db_host = 'localhost';
    $db = 'crossfit';
    
    
Currently, I am trying to figure out how to connect properly my webpage to my database. Also, I am trying to create a new user at /dashboard/dashboard_user.php and save this new user at the database crossfit.sql tb_user.

It's done.

Now I will create the new functions for dashboard_exercise and dashboard_workout.
